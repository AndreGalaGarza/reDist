```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This vignette shows the various usages for the re_dist() function and compares them to the original implementation of dist() in base R.

## Overview

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
b <- c(6, 7, 6, 1)
c <- c(1, 2, 2, 5)
d <- c(8, 9, 0, 1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
