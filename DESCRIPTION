Description: This package reimplements the base R function dist() as accurately as possible. When given a data matrix as input, re_dist() calculates the distance between each pair of rows in the input matrix using the specified distance metric. The result is stored as a dist object from base R, which is a special single-dimensional vector object that resembles a lower triangular matrix.
